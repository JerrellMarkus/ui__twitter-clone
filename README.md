# :page_with_curl: about
i made this project for fun and also to challenge myself in learn more about react.js and css


this project has no functionality only the visual (mobile, table, desktop) has been created

**[you can see live app here](https://emkis-twitter-clone.netlify.app)**

# :hammer: how it was built
this project was developed with the following technologies:

- [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) *styles built from the ground up*

# :electric_plug: how to use
to clone this repository and run this app, you'll need **[git](https://git-scm.com)** and **[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** installed on your computer.

i highly recommend **[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)** for handling node packages faster, but you can use npm if you want, no problem.

**from your command line *(using npm)*:**

```bash
# clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/emkis/twitter-clone.git

# go into the repository
$ cd twitter-clone

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# run the app in development mode
$ npm run start
```
