# :page_with_curl: about
i made this responsive twitter ui clone for study purposes.

this project has no functionality, only the visuals (mobile, table, desktop) has been created, all styles were built from the ground up

**[you can see live app here](https://emkis-twitter-clone.netlify.app)**

# :hammer: how it was built
this project was developed with the following technologies:

- [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com)

# :electric_plug: how to use
to clone this repository and run this app, you'll need **[git](https://git-scm.com)** and **[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** installed on your computer.

i highly recommend **[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)** for handling node packages faster, but you can use npm if you want, no problem.

**from your command line *(using npm)*:**

```bash
# clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/emkis/twitter-clone.git

# go into the repository
$ cd twitter-clone

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# run the app in development mode
$ npm run start
```
